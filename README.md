# Parallel square-root statistical linear regression for inference in nonlinear state space models
A generic library for linear and non-linear Gaussian smoothing problems. 
The code leverages JAX and implements several linearization algorithms, 
both in a sequential and parallel fashion, as well as low-memory cost algorithms computing gradients of required quantities 
(such as the pseudo-loglikelihood of the system).

This code was written by [Adrien Corenflos](https://github.com/AdrienCorenflos) and [Fatemeh Yaghoobi](https://github.com/Fatemeh-Yaghoobi) as a companion code for the article 
"Parallel square-root statistical linear regression for inference in nonlinear state space models" 
by Fatemeh Yaghoobi, Adrien Corenflos, Sakira Hassan, and Simo Särkkä, ArXiv link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00426
